# AirportSimulator
An implementation of an airport simulator.

I implemented a small simulator in order to test certain parameters, which may include the number of runways an airport can have and how that
affects a simulator. Service time, how long it takes for a plane to use the runway and get off, how frequently new
arriving and departing planes appear and how long the simulation runs for.
